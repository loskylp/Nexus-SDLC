**Profile:** [Casual | Commercial | Critical | Vital]
**Artifact Weight:** [Sketch | Draft | Blueprint | Spec]

*Distribution template. On project start, the Methodologist copies this to `process/methodologist/manifest-v1.md` and fills it in. Subsequent versions are written as `manifest-v2.md`, `manifest-v3.md`, etc. — all in `process/methodologist/`. The current Manifest is always the highest-numbered file in that directory. Do not edit directly; invoke the Methodologist to produce or update.*
